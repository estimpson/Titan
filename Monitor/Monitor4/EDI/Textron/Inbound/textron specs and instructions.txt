*** The work performed is for the Avilla, IN plant. The Windsor plant was not online at time work was completed. If the Windsor plant sends their data in the
***same format as Avilla, this work can be used to translate the Windsor data. If the data is not in the same format as Avilla, more work may be required for 
***the translation of the Windsor data.

The form used to translate EDI to flat file is TE3_DELFOR_D_Dr96A_Textron Auto^_000912. This was the only form available from Harbinger at the
time this work was completed.

Mapping of data elements

	BGM02+'/'+1DTM0102 (delivery forcast no. and release date) -----> order_detail.release_number
	4NAD0201 (ship to id) -----> used to find blanket order
	1LIN0301 (Kautex part) -----> used to find blanket order
	1PIA0201 (Kautex PO) -----> used to find blanket order if edi setups check po is turned on
	1PIA0301 (Kautex ECL) -----> used to compare to ECL in order header. If different an exception will print when release exceptions are requested.
	2FTX0401+2FTX0402 (Kautex notes) -----> Will print when request for release exceptions are printed
	2LOC0201 (Kautex dock id) -----> order_header.dock_code
	1QTY0101 (Quantity type see page 5-25 in implementation guide) ------> 	If 1 then 1QTY0102 = order_detail.qty
									If 3 then 1QTY0102 = order header fab or raw cum
									If 48 then 1QTY0102  used in report
									If 70 then 1QTY0102 used to compare to order_header.our_cum for cum discrepency
									If 135 then 1QTY0102 = order_detail.qty
	1SCC01 (Delivery Plan status see page 5-26 in implementation guide) ----->	If 1 then 1QTY0102 is firm release
									If 2 then 1QTY0102 is order_header.fab_cum
									If 3 then 1QTY0102 is order_header.raw_cum
									If 4 then 1QTY0102 is planning release
									If 5 then 1QTY0102 is past due release
	4DTM0101(Date type see page 5-28 in implementation guide) ----->		If 2 then 4DTM0102 deliver date - number of transit days -> order_detail.due_date
									If 10 then 4DTM0102 shipment date -> order_detail.due_date
									If 50 then 4DTM0102 last received date -> report
									If 51 cumulative start date-> not mapped
									If 52 cumulative end date -> then order_header.fab_date or raw_date depending on QTY0102
									If 194 period start date-> not mapped
									If 206 period stop date-> not mapped
								
								
Data Setups Required

	edi_setups.parent_destination=edi ship to id for each Textron plant destination
	edi_setups.id_code_type = thr number of transit days used to calculate a shipment date if 4DTM0101 = 2
	edi_setups.check_po = 'Y' if you will 1) ship more than one concurrently or 2) you want an exception report when Textron changes their PO number
	order_header.customer_po = the current po from Textron
	order_header.engineering_level = the current engineering level from Textron
