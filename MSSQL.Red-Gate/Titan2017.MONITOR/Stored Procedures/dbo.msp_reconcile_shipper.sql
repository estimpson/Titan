(	@shipper	integer )
as
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 	This procedure reconciles the quantity and standard quantity staged to a shipper,
--	caculates the shipper container information, sets boxes and pallets staged
--	fields in shipper detail and shipper header, and sets the status of the shipper to
--	(S)taged or (O)pen as appropriate.
--	This procedure sets quantity original and quantity required on Outside Process,
--	Return to Vendor, and Quick Shippers.  Unused line items are removed.
--
--	Arguments:	@shipper	mandatory
--
--	Modifications:	09 FEB 1999, Eric E. Stimpson	Original
--			09 JUN 1999, Eric E. Stimpson	Modified format.
--							Added computation of quantity original and quantity required.
--							Added removal of unused line items.
--
--	Returns:	 0		success
--			-1		shipper not found
--			-2		error, shipper was already closed
--			-3		error, invalid part was staged to this shipper
--
--	Process:
--	1. Ensure shipper is not closed.
--	2. Ensure shipper exists.
--	3. Ensure no invalid parts are staged to this shipper.
--	4. Reconcile quantity and standard quantity staged to shipper.
--	5. Refresh shipper container information.
--	6. Set boxes and pallets staged fields in shipper detail and shipper header.
--	7. Set the status of the shipper to (S)taged or (O)pen.
--	8. Set quantity original and quantity required on Quick, RTV, or Outside shippers.
--	9. Remove shipper detail with no quantity required.
